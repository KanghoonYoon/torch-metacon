# Debiased Graph Poisoning Attack via Contrastive Surrogate Objective
Pytorch Implmentation of Debiased Graph Poisoning Attack via Contrastive Surrogate Objective

We refer to the <ins>DeepRobust</ins> library to build our implementation **src/**. [https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust](https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust).

## Dataset
We use four datasets: Cora, Cora ML, Citeseer, and Polblogs in Datasets of DeepRobust library.
Note that these datasets are the largest connected component (LCC) of the graph datasets.

## Implementation  

You can conduct the experiment of **Metacon** by running the file in **shell/** directory.

* Train / Test of Metacon
``` python  

bash shell/test_metacon.sh  

```
